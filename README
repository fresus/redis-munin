This is a Munin public domain plugin for Redis.

It tries to extensively cover Redis INFO output, while keeping the
dependencies low (currently, only needs awk, redis-cli and Munin 1.4+).

It can monitor several Redis instances, remotes or locals to the server.

To install : just copy the redis_ script to your $MUNIN_LIBDIR
(on Debian, that's /usr/share/munin/plugins/).

Then create a symbolic link like this:

  ln -s '/usr/share/munin/plugins/redis_' \
        '/etc/munin/plugins/redis_instance_name'

Data connection can be set in a config file ala /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/redis_instance_name:

[redis_instance_name]
env.ip 127.0.0.1
env.port 6379
env.socket /path/to/socket.sock
env.password secret-password
env.instance instance_name
